# Deploying via the Command Line

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-docker.html)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [AWS SAM CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) v1.140.0 or greater
- The [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) build tool (included with build tools on most UNIX-like operating systems)

<Steps>

### Step 1

Make sure the AWS CLI is [properly configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) with credentials that have sufficient access to manage IAM, S3, and Lambda resources.

### Step 2

Clone this repository.

### Step 3

Copy `deploy.yml.example` to `deploy.yml`. Update the various values under `parameter_overrides` within.

### Step 4

Build the application:

```shell
$ npm run build
```

### Step 5

Deploy the application using one of the following:

```shell
# To be prompted for all configuration values before deploying
$ npm run deploy-guided

# To deploy using the current configuration, prompting only for changeset confirmation
$ npm run deploy
```

If you use the guided deploy, you'll be prompted for various configuration parameters, confirmations, and acknowledgments of specific issues (particularly the creation of IAM resources and the deployment of an open/unauthenticated Lambda Function URL). Otherwise, you'll simply be asked to confirm the calculated changeset.

### Step 6

Follow the prompts to complete the deployment process and get the resulting endpoint.
