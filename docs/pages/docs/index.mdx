## Description

A cost-effective, infinitely scalable [IIIF 2.1](https://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/) and [3.0](https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/) image API compliant service packaged as an [AWS Serverless Application](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) with minimum setup and no maintenance. Suitable for large institutional collections or small digital humanities projects. 

## Components

* A simple [Lambda Function](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) wrapper for the [iiif-processor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iiif-processor) module.
* A [Lambda Function URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-urls.html) that is used to invoke the IIIF API via HTTPS.
* A [Lambda Layer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html) containing all the dependencies for the Lambda Function.

## Prerequisites

* Some basic knowledge of AWS.
* An Amazon Web Services account with permissions to create IAM resources via the console and/or command line.
* An [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket to hold the source images to be served via IIIF.

<Callout>
  Note: The Lambda Function will be granted read access to this bucket.
